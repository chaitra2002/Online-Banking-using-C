# Online-Banking-using-C

The online banking is implemented by c programming. It is the same as one can see
while netbanking. Here the underlying idea is to present users with two choices
registering account or to login to the account. After logging to an account the user are
given choices which is displayed on screen and accordingly user can
deposit, withdraw, transfer the amount.
